# Advertising Approval
> All Carolina University advertising (other than for personnel recruitment) placed on behalf of CU, and any entity therein, in any publication or electronic medium, must be approved by the Marketing and Communication Department before being processed. The Director of Media Relations is CUâ€™s point of contact for all advertising vendors.  


## Rationale

This policy ensures:
1. Quality control, appropriateness, and consistency of Carolina University messaging and image.
2. CU receives the most competitive rates possible for all Carolina University advertising purchases.
3. CU internal communication and appropriate notice regarding messaging that has occurred among all relevant parties


## Procedures
All advertising purchased by any division, schools, department, program and/or budgetary unit within Carolina University, excluding personnel classified advertising, must be approved by the Director of Media Relations.

When necessary, Carolina University appoints external advertising agencies to provide professional advice and creative services for Carolina University branding campaigns and other key projects. All agency briefs are managed through the Marketing and Communication Department. No other Carolina University area may engage any advertising agency without the Director of Media Relations prior written approval.
