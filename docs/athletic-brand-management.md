# Athletic Brand Management
> It is essential to the success of the brand that the Bruin logo always be applied with care and respect in every application according to the brand guide.  

## Policy Procedures
Piedmont International University’s primary athletic logo consists of a wordmark and a character icon. The main lettering is meant to have a passionate and intimidating feel, that plays off of the competitive nature of the athletic program.

This is the main logo that will be used across all athletic department applications. This trademark helps audiences easily identify Piedmont International University Bruins jerseys, fan gear, social media accounts, web pages, advertisements and other materials, and enhances the professionalism of the Piedmont Bruin brand.

Piedmont International University’s secondary logos can be used in replace of the primary logo (but should never be used directly next to the primary logo).  The bear portrait can be used when the full primary logo is not already displayed in plain text. For example, the bear portrait could
be used as a profile picture on Instagram since the username will be adjacent to it in plain text.  The monogram can be used when the full primary logo does not fit proportionally. The monogram may also be used for an email signature, however, it must not be used directly next to the primary logo.

A few rules are necessary for maintaining the integrity of the brand. Do not compromise the overall look of the logo by rotating, skewing, or distorting it in any way - which includes adding unnecessary and unattractive decorations like drop shadows and outlines. Here are a few examples of how the logo should NEVER be used. This is not a full list; for questions about logo use, please contact the
Marketing and Communication Department.

* Do not rotate the logo. 
* Do not squash or stretch the logo. 
* Do not add drop shadows or other text styles.
