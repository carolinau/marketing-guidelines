3. Ensure that all information follows PIU’s design and editorial standards
4. Create centralized expertise and resources to assist the PIU community

### Project Production
The Marketing and Communication Department will review and authorize each project in one of the following ways:
1. Insert the design project in the marketing and communication production calendar and create the design in-house.
2. Outsource the design project to an approved off-campus vendor for editorial, graphics and/or printing production.
3. Work closely with PIU communicators to complete the design project within PIU Brand Standards as determined by the Marketing and Communication Department. 

Please note: The Marketing and Communication Department has responsibility for final approval of all text, messages, design, photographs, web page content and design, graphics representations and artwork for work it prepares, and for vendor-assigned work.

Template requests should be directed to the Marketing and Communication Department. Original designs are permissible but must be approved by the Marketing and Communication Department to ensure consistency with Piedmont International University’s Brand Standards.
