# Brand Standards
All Carolina University image publications and external audience communications, including all student recruitment and fundraising publications, must be designed and produced and/or pre-approved (prior to production) by the Marketing and Communication Department.

All marketing, advertising, promotional and recruitment materials (paper, media and digital) will include the Carolina University mission statement where space permits. 

## Rationale
This policy ensures high quality, visual consistency and a strong connection to Carolina University brand across all promotional materials representing Carolina University. The goals are:
1. Apply strategies to promote and protect CU’s brand
2. Guarantee that CU communicates with a consistent voice
3. Ensure that all information follows CU’s design and editorial standards
4. Create centralized expertise and resources to assist the CU community
5. Combine all CU communication to improve information flow and efficiency
6. Reduce internal and external miscommunication

## Procedures
Carolina University divisions, schools, departments and programs preparing publications (newsletters, magazines, booklets, flyers, program brochures, posters, etc.) advertisements (electronic or print), photographs, web pages and/or audio-visual presentations intended for an external audience should contact the Marketing and Communication Department for guidance and assistance.

### Project Production
The Marketing and Communication Department will review and authorize each project in one of the following ways:
1. Insert the design project in the marketing and communication production calendar and create the design in-house.
2. Outsource the design project to an approved off-campus vendor for editorial, graphics and/or printing production.
3. Work closely with CU communicators to complete the design project within CU Brand Standards as determined by the Marketing and Communication Department. 

Please note: The Marketing and Communication Department has responsibility for final approval of all text, messages, design, photographs, web page content and design, graphics representations and artwork for work it prepares, and for vendor-assigned work.

### Templates
Carolina University communicators are encouraged to use available Marketing and Communication Department design templates, which work together to establish Carolina University’s identity. Template requests should be directed to the Marketing and Communication Department. Original designs are permissible but must be approved by the Marketing and Communication Department to ensure consistency with Carolina University’s Brand Standards.

### Brand Standards
Carolina University’s logo must be prominently displayed on all products that represent Carolina University. For specifics, refer to the CU Brand Standards Style Guide.

All department logos must be created in the CU branded template. Any questions can be directed to the Marketing and Communication Department.
