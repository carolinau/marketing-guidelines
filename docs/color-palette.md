# Color Palette
Color is an integral part of brand identity. Consistent use of the color palette will not only reinforce the cohesiveness of the brand, but color also serves a psychological purpose by communicating a certain feeling to your audience. 

Deep blue is **relaxing**, and often used to convey the importance of meaningful **relationships**; it also establishes **trust**and **loyalty**. Our Columbia Blue is meant to exude **confidence**and **freedom**. Our Maroon and Grays are complementary colors and should be used with discretion.
