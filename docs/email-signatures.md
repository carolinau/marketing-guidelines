# Email Signatures

To change your email signature in Gmail, click settings – see all settings – scroll down to the signature. Create your email signature using the model below. Sometimes you will have to change the signature on each device depending on the apps you use. For example, Gmail app users will have to repeat these steps on their iPhones.

All CU Employees should use the following layout for their default signature.  No other text, quotes, phrases, or links should be used without administrative approval in advance.  All font should be Arial (when available) or Sans Serif.

Name and Credential [bold, 12pt or “Large” in Gmail]
Title [italics, 11pt or “Normal” in Gmail]
Office: (phone number) | Email: (email address) [11pt or “Normal” in Gmail]
