# Email Signatures

To change your email signature, click settings – see all settings – scroll down to the signature. Copy and paste your email signature from below and fill it in with your information. Sometimes you will have to change the signature on each device depending on the app you use. For example, Gmail app users will have to repeat these steps on their iPhones.
