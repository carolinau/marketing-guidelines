**URL**: The URL of the webpage the visitor is going to, commonly the program page.
**Source**: The name of the website the visitor is coming from, in this case it will always be facebook.
**Medium**: The type of ad being delivered. Facebook Ads are most commonly a cost-per-click type, so enter cpc.
**Name**: This will always be the abbreviated degree type plus the program name: ba_criminal_justice.
**Term**: The target demographic of the ad.
**Content**: Enter a couple keywords from the ad messaging. Ensure this is unique between ads.

## Considerations
-  Always use lowercase letters-  Use underscores (_) instead of spaces between words-  Use the same source, medium, name, and term for different ads within an ad group
