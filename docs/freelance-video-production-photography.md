# Freelance Video Production/Photography
> When appropriate, the Director of Media Relations will refer CU community members to approved freelance videographers and photographers. All freelance workers must be preapproved by the Marketing and Communication Department and meet Carolina University requirements for CU vendors.  

## Rationale
This policy ensures that Carolina University marketing and promotional videos and photographs taken by an outside party become the intellectual property of Carolina University.

## Procedures
When CU community members contract a freelance videographer or photographer or use work created by a freelance worker, both parties must agree on the Carolina University not only commissions the right to use that work but also purchases the ownership of the work. All work produced by a freelance worker contracting with Carolina University become the permanent property of Carolina University. This policy is intended to prohibit the freelance worker, or any third party, from selling or providing the work done to another publication without the express consent of Carolina University. All video and photo work must be pre-approved by the Marketing and Communication Department before being
distributed externally for marketing purposes.

All raw footage taken by freelance workers must be provided in the original, uncompressed format on which it was taken unless an agreement has been reached for conversion of that video to another format. Finished productions will be provided in their original format unless an alternative file type has been agreed upon. All photos taken by freelance must be provided, digitally in their original, uncompressed size and format, with a minimum resolution of 300 dpi, to the Marketing and Communication Department within three calendar days of the contracted work. The Marketing and Communication Department maintains CUâ€™s official digital/print photography library.
