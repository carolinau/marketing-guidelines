It is the policy of Carolina University that the development and application of Carolina University’s brand standards are determined by the Marketing and Communications Department as approved by the office of the President.

## Procedures
All Carolina University community members are required to use Carolina University seal, publication guidelines and graphics standards as outlined in the CU Brand Standards Style Guide.

Carolina University’s name and seal are the official emblems of CU and are only to be used for official Carolina University purposes.

The Carolina University seal, along with official accepted variations, are the primary graphic marks for Carolina University. The seal is designed to promote Carolina University’s visual identity and brand and is to be used on all internal and external printed and electronic materials representing Carolina University. The seal must also be used by all Carolina University divisions, schools, departments and programs, on all internal and external printed and electronic materials representing Carolina University (including letterhead, business cards, reports, magazines, newsletters, presentations, web pages, and temporary and permanent signage). The seal is not to be modified by changing the font, proportions, color or other design alterations. Carolina University seal usage is not permitted in publications and displays that are not under the official sponsorship of Carolina University. Questions regarding the use of Carolina University seal in publications or displays should be addressed to the Marketing and Communications department.

Commercial use of Carolina University’s name or seal is prohibited except in those instances expressly authorized by Carolina University’s Marketing and Communications Department. Anyone interested in becoming licensed vendors are asked to meet with the Director of Media Relations.
1. All branded Carolina University items that are being sold must be ordered through a licensed vendor. Licensed vendors have access to official art files and have a streamlined approval process to ensure that the product has been reviewed and approved.
2. It is strongly recommended that items not being sold also be ordered through licensed vendors because of their familiarity with CU’s brand standards. Unlicensed vendors may be used only with written approval from the Director of Media Relations. An approved proof is required prior to production by an unlicensed vendor.
