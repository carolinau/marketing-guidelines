# Video/Photography Permission/Model Releases
> When possible, Piedmont International University requires written permission of students and/or other adults who are primarily featured in a Piedmont International University video production or photograph.   

## Rationale
The purpose of this policy and procedure is to ensure the Piedmont International University is obtaining appropriate permission to use the image or likeness of individuals for promotional purposes.

## Procedures
At a minimum, whenever possible, Piedmont International University videographers and/or photographers shall identify themselves verbally or by wearing a PIU press badge, informing potential featured students and/or other adults of their intent of the video and/or photograph and its end use. When the subjects primarily featured are minors, written permission must be obtained from a parent or guardian. The only remedy available to a featured PIU student or other adult who did not provide permission to the university is the removal of such video/photography from all future Piedmont International University marketing materials. This policy does not apply to large public event settings (athletic events or commencement ceremonies). When video or photos are supplied by an organization on or off PIU’s campus, permission to use the images is implied. The Marketing and Communication Department will work with the organization or request that the organization’s representative to confirm the permission and ensure that appropriate video and photo credits are published.
